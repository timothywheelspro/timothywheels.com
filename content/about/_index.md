## Who I Am

I'm Timothy "Fly" Wheels -- a systems thinker who treats life as infrastructure you can route, optimize, and scale.

I bridge technical expertise with human experience, applying network architecture principles to leadership development, organizational dynamics, and creative workflows. My work demonstrates that the same protocols that manage data packets across the internet can manage decision-making across a human life.

I've spent **15-20 years navigating homelessness** across Atlanta, Columbus, Houston, and Austin. I've performed poetry on **Def Poetry Jam, BET's Lyric Cafe, and V-103's Quiet Storm**. I served in the **U.S. Air Force**. I currently work as a **Waterspider at Amazon ORF3** in Suffolk, Virginia while pursuing a **CIS degree at DeVry University** (3.87 GPA).

Through it all, I've been building the **Control Your World (CYW) framework** -- a systematic approach to turning every experience into infrastructure that compounds over time.

## What I Do

### Systems Thinking and Infrastructure Architecture

I treat human systems the same way network engineers treat data infrastructure:

- **Layer 0 (Physical):** Raw experiences and events
- **Layer 1 (Data Link):** Documentation and capture systems
- **Layer 2 (Network):** Routing protocols for value distribution
- **Layer 3 (Transport):** Classification and prioritization
- **Layer 4 (Session):** Context management across personas
- **Layer 5 (Presentation):** Format optimization for different audiences
- **Layer 6 (Application):** Deployment to specific platforms
- **Layer 7 (User):** Impact measurement and feedback loops

This isn't metaphor. This is methodology.

### Content and Leadership Development

**Awareness In Action Series:**  
Essays applying technical infrastructure concepts to human challenges. Topics include PoC vs. Production systems, validation theater in leadership, and reciprocal value networks.

**Poetry and Performance:**  
Spoken word that compresses complex systems thinking into emotionally resonant performance pieces. Professional background includes national platforms and current work organizing poetry events at Amazon.

**CYW Framework Development:**  
Building Contruil LLC around systematic approaches to value farming, multi-endpoint routing, and infrastructure-based decision-making.

## Current Projects

### Virgil OS

A multi-model AI orchestration system routing cognitive work across five specialized models:
- **Perplexity** (research layer)
- **Claude** (narrative expansion)
- **Gemini** (clarity audit)
- **DeepSeek** (structural critique)
- **ChatGPT** (final integration)

Currently in PoC phase, validating logic and routing protocols.

### Amazon Internal Mobility

Preparing application for Process Assistant or RME Tech roles (target: April 2025). Positioning: systems thinking + precision documentation + morale building.

### NSLS Executive Leadership

Serving as Executive Membership Outreach Coordinator for the DeVry University chapter under Dr. Kyle Flowers, managing 500+ members and developing leadership programming.

### Patent Filings

Documenting Triangle Test Protocol and Four-Gate Authorization systems for patent filing (deadline: December 30, 2025).

### Live2Lead Q1 2026

Confirmed speaking engagement on systems thinking for leadership infrastructure.

## Philosophy

**"Control Your World"** means treating yourself as infrastructure:

- **Value Farming:** Extract, process, and deploy value from every experience
- **Multi-Endpoint Routing:** Send the same raw material to different destinations for different purposes
- **Strategic Opacity:** Give systems exactly what they're rated for -- no more, no less
- **Reciprocal Networks:** Build long-term relationship infrastructure instead of transactional exchanges
- **Designed Margin:** Architect resilience and recovery protocols before you need them

This isn't productivity advice. This is infrastructure engineering applied to human systems.
