Timothy "Fly" Wheels is a systems architect and sovereign operator tracing a 20-year routing protocol across military, creative, warehouse, academic, and organizational systems.

This is not a resume. It is a network diagram of how routing logic formed, where it runs today, and where it is headed.

## Origin Protocol: Where the Routing Logic Formed

### 2004-2014 | Military Service -> Creative Performance
**System insight:** Hierarchical command structures are networks with explicit access control lists. Applied this to stage presence (Def Poetry Jam, BET's Lyric Cafe) - audience as endpoint, performance as packet delivery, feedback as acknowledgment protocol.

**Key translation:** Clarity under pressure is not removing complexity - it is routing it through the right channels at the right time.

---

### 2015-2020 | Warehouse Operations -> Infrastructure Thinking
**System insight:** Amazon fulfillment centers are physical Layer 2 switches. Every package is a frame, every conveyor junction is a routing decision, every manager dashboard is a monitoring protocol.

**Key translation:** Developed the "extreme visibility" audit methodology - later formalized as the Triangle Test Protocol. Got written up for being too thorough. Turned the liability into the foundation of CYW.

---

### 2021-2023 | Academic Re-Entry -> Formal Network Training
**System insight:** DeVry networking curriculum (NETW191, NETW212) provided formal language for intuitive system mapping - human systems as network topologies.

**Key translation:** Applied VLAN segmentation to AI collaboration. Each model became a dedicated routing layer with controlled inter-VLAN communication. The CYW pipeline was born.

## Active Infrastructure: Current Nodes in the Network

### 2024-Present | Multi-Role Operation

**Amazon ORF3 Waterspider** (Suffolk, VA)
- Managing physical infrastructure across 9 football fields
- Applying network troubleshooting methodology to supply chain bottlenecks
- Systematic audit protocols (safety, efficiency, inventory accuracy)

**DeVry CIS Student** (Pursuing Bachelor's)
- NETW191, NETW212 (switching, routing, VLANs, ACLs)
- ECON312 (CapEx/OpEx frameworks, cost-benefit at scale)
- Translating every academic concept into operational application

**NSLS Executive Membership Outreach Coordinator**
- 500+ member network management
- Event logistics, speaker coordination, engagement metrics
- Building systematic communication pipelines for organizational clarity

**Contruil LLC Founder** (Control Your World Framework)
- Developing multi-model AI orchestration methodology
- Patent applications: Triangle Test Protocol, Four-Gate Authorization
- Newsletter: "Awareness In Action" (systems thinking for sovereign individuals)

## Forward Deployment: Where the Packets Are Headed

### Q1 2025 | Internal Amazon Mobility
**Target roles:** Process Assistant, RME Technician  
**Timeline:** Application by April 2025  
**Strategy:** Leverage demonstrated systems thinking + formal networking credentials + safety/operational track record

---

### Q2-Q3 2025 | Bay Area Relocation
**Objective:** Position within tech infrastructure ecosystem  
**Focus:** Network engineering, DevOps, AI operations roles  
**Asset:** CYW framework as proof of multi-domain systems capability

---

### Q1 2026 | Live2Lead Speaking Engagement
**Platform:** Leadership conference presentation  
**Topic:** "Clarity Architecture: How Network Thinking Transforms Decision-Making"  
**Deliverable:** Scale CYW methodology to executive/leadership audience

---

### 2026+ | CYW Framework Productization
**Infrastructure:** Unity/3D spatial clarity tools  
**IP Protection:** Patent portfolio (Triangle Test, Four-Gate, multi-model orchestration)  
**Distribution:** Newsletter -> Workshops -> Licensing/Consulting

## The Pattern Across 20 Years

| Year Range | Role | System Insight |
|------------|------|----------------|
| 2004-2014 | Military -> Performance | Command structures = ACLs, Performance = packet delivery |
| 2015-2020 | Warehouse Operations | Fulfillment centers = Layer 2 switches, Audits = monitoring protocols |
| 2021-2023 | Academic Network Training | Formal VLAN/routing maps to human systems architecture |
| 2024-Present | Multi-role operator | Amazon + NSLS + Contruil = parallel network orchestration |
| 2025-2026 | Mobility + Scale | Internal promotion -> Bay Area -> Live2Lead -> CYW productization |

## The Core Thesis

Every system I have operated in - military, creative, warehouse, academic, organizational, entrepreneurial - follows the same routing logic:

**Layer 0:** Establish clarity infrastructure  
**Layer 1-7:** Map the OSI model to human decision-making  
**Routing Protocol:** Explicit boundaries, clear failure modes, predictable cost of change

The tools change. The topology principles do not.

**This is how you Control Your World.**
