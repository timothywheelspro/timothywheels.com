## Routing Rules

1. **LinkedIn** = Professional mobility, hiring managers, formal introductions  
2. **Email** = Collaboration, consulting, speaking, detailed proposals  
3. **GitHub** = Code review, framework exploration, technical validation  
4. **Newsletter** = Ongoing systems thinking, no commitment required

---

## Response Protocol

- **Recruiters:** 24-48 hour response, include role-specific architecture proposal
- **Collaborators:** 48-72 hour response, include CYW framework alignment assessment
- **Event organizers:** 72-hour response, include audience-tailored content outline
- **Consulting:** 48-hour discovery call scheduling, followed by scoped proposal

No auto-responders. No templated replies. Every response is routed through the same clarity layer you see on this site.

**This is how you Control Your World.**

Clear context. Explicit protocol. Predictable routing.
