# Contingency Responses — IEEE Appeal Scenarios

This page provides prepared, neutral responses mapped to common institutional reply patterns. Each scenario includes a calibrated reply and a recommended next action.

## Scenario 1 — No Response / Silence

**Response:**  
We are following up on our appeal submission and request confirmation of receipt. The evidence packet is versioned, hash-verified, and available for independent review. Please confirm the review timeline or the appropriate contact for status.

**Next action:** Send a second follow-up after 7 calendar days; log date/time.

## Scenario 2 — Generic Denial Without Specifics

**Response:**  
Thank you for the response. For procedural clarity, we request the specific basis for the automated flag, including the detection tool used, the similarity score or match report, and the source material used for comparison. This will allow us to respond to the precise findings.

**Next action:** Request a written explanation and an evidence basis.

## Scenario 3 — Reassertion of "AI-Generated Code" Claim

**Response:**  
We acknowledge the concern. The packet documents AI usage limited to conceptual guidance and includes a verbatim transcript (E-017A) with reconciled message counts. Please indicate which submitted code segments are alleged to be AI-generated and the comparative source, so we can address the specific claim.

**Next action:** Ask for the flagged segments and source comparison.

## Scenario 4 — Procedural Deflection (Confidentiality of Methods)

**Response:**  
We understand that detection methods may be confidential. We are not requesting proprietary details, only the specific flagged segments, the scope of the comparison, and the resulting similarity basis. This is necessary for procedural fairness and a targeted response.

**Next action:** Narrow the request to code segments and comparison scope.

## Scenario 5 — Partial Resolution

**Response:**  
Thank you for the partial resolution. Please confirm the remaining open items and whether any additional evidence is required. We can provide targeted supplements if needed.

**Next action:** Ask for a checklist of remaining steps.

## Scenario 6 — Full Reversal

**Response:**  
Thank you for the reversal and the committee's review. Please confirm the reinstatement details and any updated records we should retain for compliance purposes.

**Next action:** Request written confirmation and archive.

## Tone Principles (Always Apply)

1. Factual, not adversarial
2. Specific, not general
3. Proportional response
4. No ultimatums
5. Preserve the record
