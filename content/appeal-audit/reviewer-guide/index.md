# How to Read This Packet in 20 Minutes

This guide is designed for institutional reviewers, ombudsmen, or external auditors to reach an independent assessment without relying on participant testimony.

## Phase 1 — Orientation (3 minutes)

**What to read:** Section 1 (Cover Letter)  
**What to look for:** scope, claims, and the requested action  
**Key questions:** What is being requested? What is explicitly not being claimed?

## Phase 2 — The Critical Exhibit (5 minutes)

**What to read:** Section 5 (E-017A Verbatim Dialogue Summary)  
**What to look for:** message breakdown, image-only messages, no code generation  
**Key questions:** Does the transcript show conceptual guidance only? Are counts reconciled to JSON source?

## Phase 3 — Evidence Architecture (4 minutes)

**What to read:** Section 2 (Evidence Index Summary)  
**What to look for:** evidence IDs, confidence levels, and classification lanes  
**Key questions:** Is the evidence map internally consistent? Are Tier 1 items clearly identified?

## Phase 4 — Integrity Verification (3 minutes)

**What to read:** Section 8 (Manifest & Verification)  
**What to look for:** hash list, manifest version, verification tool  
**Key questions:** Can two hashes be spot-verified against `manifest.json`?

## Phase 5 — Gap Disclosure (2 minutes)

**What to read:** Section 7 (Gap Disclosure)  
**What to look for:** explicit acknowledgments of missing artifacts  
**Key questions:** Are gaps disclosed without speculation or inference?

## Phase 6 — Procedural Context (3 minutes)

**What to read:** Section 3 (Forensic Timeline Reconstruction) and Section 4 (Key Evidence Excerpts)  
**What to look for:** timestamp integrity, hackathon window alignment, chain of custody  
**Key questions:** Do timestamps align with the competition window? Is the chain of custody documented?
