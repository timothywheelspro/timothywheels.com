## Case Study 003 — CYW Integrated Technical Infrastructure

**Role:** Systems Architect / Platform Engineer  
**Status:** Active / Iterative Deployment  
**Timeline:** 2023–Present

---

## 1. Context
As my professional work expanded across advocacy, education, technology, and
community systems, I encountered increasing risk from platform dependency,
algorithmic opacity, and undocumented workflows.

Existing tools did not provide sufficient governance, auditability, or cost
transparency for long-term independent operation.

To maintain ownership, credibility, and sustainability, I required an
integrated technical platform capable of managing verification, deployment,
and accountability at scale.

---

## 2. Problem
Conventional creator, cloud, and AI platforms lacked:

- Transparent governance controls
- Verifiable authorship and provenance
- Cost-performance visibility
- Independent deployment authority
- Cryptographic auditability
- Reproducible release processes

Without these, technical work could not be reliably trusted, defended, or
scaled.

---

## 3. Action
I designed and implemented an integrated infrastructure stack combining
governance frameworks, cloud economics modeling, evidence chains, and automated
deployment pipelines.

Key actions included:

- Developed CYW and Virgil OS governance frameworks
- Implemented Triangle Test and Four-Gate authorization protocols
- Built evidence vaults with SHA-256 ledgers
- Integrated OpenTimestamps verification
- Created automated release and signing pipelines
- Deployed Hugo-based public verification portals
- Implemented GitHub Actions validation workflows
- Produced cost and topology modeling artifacts
- Established signed governance release processes

---

## 4. System
The resulting platform operates as a multi-layered governance stack:

### Platform Layer
- timothywheels.com (public verification hub)
- cyw-os.com (development environment)
- contruil.com (enterprise framework site)

### Governance Layer
- CYW Framework
- Virgil OS
- Triangle Test Protocol
- Four-Gate Authorization Chain
- VLAN-style routing models

### Evidence Layer
- Evidence vault with cryptographic hashes
- OpenTimestamps seals
- Signed manifests and anchor records
- Public verification endpoints

### Operations Layer
- Automated release scripts
- GPG-signed commits and tags
- CI verification workflows
- Backup and recovery protocols

### Documentation Layer
- Case studies
- Grant packets
- Architecture diagrams
- Evidence bundles

These layers integrate to ensure traceability from ideation through public
deployment.

---

## 5. Outcome
This infrastructure enabled:

- Verifiable public portfolios
- Auditable governance releases
- Controlled cost-performance planning
- Reproducible deployment pipelines
- Institutional-grade documentation
- Independent platform authority

The system supports sustained technical leadership without reliance on opaque
third-party platforms.

## 6. Evidence
Representative artifacts include:

- GitHub: github.com/timothywheelspro/*
- scripts/release.sh
- .github/workflows/verify.yml
- build_packet.py
- seal_all_repos.sh
- verify_anchor_all.sh
- Evidence vault (~/virgil/evidence_vault/)
- manifest_v1.md, metadata.json
- anchor_manifest.md, anchor_status_overview.md
- Public verification portal (/verification/)
- Case Studies 001–002 and portfolio spine

---

## Summary
This project demonstrates end-to-end systems architecture integrating AI
governance, cryptographic verification, cost modeling, and public deployment.
The CYW infrastructure provides durable technical accountability for complex,
multi-domain work.
