## Case Study 002 — Homelessness & Healing Systems Work

**Role:** Independent Systems Designer / Community Advocate / Participant  
**Timeline:** ~2005–2025  
**Status:** Ongoing / Stabilized Phase

---

## 1. Context
For approximately 15–20 years of adult life, I experienced recurring housing
instability, employment precarity, and limited access to consistent support
infrastructure.

During this period:

- Housing was unstable or temporary
- Employment relied on short-term and gig platforms
- Transportation access was unreliable
- Records and credentials were frequently lost
- Service access varied by city and provider

I operated within multiple urban systems, including Atlanta, Houston, Austin,
and Columbus, interacting with shelters, workforce programs, nonprofits, and
temporary staffing agencies.

---

## 2. Problem
The primary issue was systemic fragmentation:

- Disconnected service providers
- Loss of employment and training records
- No unified proof of skills
- Transportation barriers to job access
- Algorithm-driven hiring filters
- Limited continuity between services

Individuals were forced to restart progress after each disruption.

Stability was structurally difficult to sustain.

---

## 3. Action
In response, I developed personal continuity and accountability systems:

- Documented informal and formal work history
- Maintained independent skill records
- Leveraged AI tools for planning and analysis
- Built independent resume and portfolio systems
- Established an LLC
- Implemented weekly self-review routines
- Engaged with community organizations as recipient and volunteer

---

## 4. System
These actions evolved into a personal resilience framework:

- Proof-of-work documentation
- Digital identity infrastructure
- Evidence preservation workflows
- Employment transition tracking
- Reflective governance routines
- Community reintegration pathways

The system reduced dependence on fragmented platforms.

---

## 5. Outcome
Outcomes include:

- Sustained full-time employment
- Registered LLC (Dec 2025)
- Stable housing lease
- Re-entry into leadership organizations
- Functional portfolio platform
- Increased economic stability

The system now supports continuous growth.

---

## 6. Evidence
- LLC registration (Dec 2025)
- timothywheels.com portfolio
- GitHub repositories
- Salvation Army service records
- Employment records (Amazon, gig platforms)
- Self-governance meeting transcripts
- NSLS documentation

---

## Summary
This case demonstrates applied systems engineering under structural
constraints. Independent governance and documentation practices converted
instability into a platform for long-term professional and community
engagement.
