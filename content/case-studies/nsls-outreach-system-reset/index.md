## Case Study 001 — NSLS Outreach System Reset

**Role:** Executive Membership Outreach Coordinator  
**Organization:** DeVry University — NSLS Chapter  
**Timeline:** February 3–4, 2026

---

## 1. Context
When I joined the DeVry NSLS executive team, the chapter was navigating a
leadership transition. Communication practices were informal, role expectations
were unclear, and new officers had limited guidance for converting policy into
consistent member engagement.

Formal documentation existed, but there was no unified operational framework
connecting leadership intent, outreach execution, and member support.

## 2. Problem
The core issue was not effort, but structure:

- Ambiguity in executive responsibilities
- Fragmented documentation
- Limited continuity between leadership terms
- Inconsistent outreach practices
- Minimal process visibility for members

Without intervention, these gaps risked reducing engagement and weakening
long-term organizational impact.

## 3. Action
Between February 3–4, 2026, I initiated a rapid system reset focused on
stabilization and clarity:

- Consolidated outreach and academic support documents
- Standardized communication workflows
- Developed reference materials for member engagement
- Created draft legacy and graduation resources
- Applied reflective analysis to identify structural gaps
- Established baseline operating practices for continuity

## 4. System
The reset produced a lightweight, repeatable outreach and documentation system:

- Centralized working documents
- Standardized outreach templates
- Academic integrity support workflows
- Leadership continuity resources
- Documentation-first operating practices

This converted informal processes into durable operational assets.

## 5. Outcome
Immediate outcomes included:

- Restored operational clarity
- Improved document usability
- Increased peer-to-peer engagement
- Enhanced academic support resources
- Reduced reliance on ad-hoc communication

Executive members began using standardized formats and updating shared materials
independently, creating continuity beyond a single term.

## 6. Evidence
- NSLS Academic Excellence resource: "Documenting Revision with Word Track Changes"
- Leadership workflow guides and templates
- Graduation and legacy documentation tools
- Automated PDF resource generation scripts
- Dated execution logs (Feb 3–4, 2026)
