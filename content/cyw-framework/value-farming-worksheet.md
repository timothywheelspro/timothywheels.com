# Value Farming Worksheet
## Where Does Your Time Actually Go?

---

## Purpose

This worksheet helps you audit your current time and energy allocation, identify mismatches between where resources go and where they should go, and design routing rules that protect what matters.

Complete this honestly. The goal is clarity, not judgment.

## Part 1: Current State Audit

### Time Allocation (Last 7 Days)

Estimate hours spent in each category:

| Category | Hours | % of Waking Time |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| **Work (primary employment)** | _____ | _____% |
| **Work (side projects/business)** | _____ | _____% |
| **Institutional compliance** (appointments, paperwork, bureaucracy) | _____ | _____% |
| **Skill development** (learning, practice, training) | _____ | _____% |
| **Health** (exercise, medical, recovery) | _____ | _____% |
| **Relationships** (family, friends, community) | _____ | _____% |
| **Rest** (actual rest, not distraction) | _____ | _____% |
| **Reactive time** (unplanned interruptions, emergencies) | _____ | _____% |
| **Low-value consumption** (scrolling, passive entertainment) | _____ | _____% |

**Total waking hours (approx 112/week):** _____

### Energy Allocation

Not all hours are equal. Rate each category by energy drain:

| Category | Energy Impact |
|----------|---------------|
| Work (primary) | Energizing / Neutral / Draining |
| Work (side) | Energizing / Neutral / Draining |
| Institutional compliance | Energizing / Neutral / Draining |
| Skill development | Energizing / Neutral / Draining |
| Health | Energizing / Neutral / Draining |
| Relationships | Energizing / Neutral / Draining |
| Rest | Energizing / Neutral / Draining |

**Observation:** Which draining activities consume the most time?

## Part 2: Value Assessment

### What Compounds?

List activities where effort today creates returns tomorrow:

1. _________________________________________________________________
2. _________________________________________________________________
3. _________________________________________________________________

### What Depletes?

List activities that consume without returning:

1. _________________________________________________________________
2. _________________________________________________________________
3. _________________________________________________________________

### What's Mandatory But Not Valuable?

List obligations that must be completed but don't compound:

1. _________________________________________________________________
2. _________________________________________________________________
3. _________________________________________________________________

## Part 3: Ideal State Design

### If You Had Full Control

How would you allocate your 112 waking hours?

| Category | Ideal Hours | Current Gap |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Work (primary) | _____ | _____ |
| Work (side/business) | _____ | _____ |
| Institutional compliance | _____ | _____ |
| Skill development | _____ | _____ |
| Health | _____ | _____ |
| Relationships | _____ | _____ |
| Rest | _____ | _____ |
| Buffer (unallocated) | _____ | _____ |

**Biggest gap:** _________________________________________________

## Part 4: Routing Rules

### Protect List

Three things that get time no matter what:

1. _________________________________________________________________
2. _________________________________________________________________
3. _________________________________________________________________

### Compress List

Three things to complete as fast as possible (front-load, then done):

1. _________________________________________________________________
2. _________________________________________________________________
3. _________________________________________________________________

### Eliminate List

Three things to stop doing entirely:

1. _________________________________________________________________
2. _________________________________________________________________
3. _________________________________________________________________

### Delegate/Automate List

Three things someone or something else should handle:

1. _________________________________________________________________
2. _________________________________________________________________
3. _________________________________________________________________

---

## Part 5: Implementation

### This Week's Experiment

**One thing I'll protect:** ________________________________________

**How I'll protect it:** ___________________________________________

**One thing I'll compress:** _______________________________________

**How I'll compress it:** __________________________________________

**One thing I'll eliminate:** ______________________________________

**How I'll eliminate it:** _________________________________________

---

### Check-In Questions (Weekly)

1. Did the protected thing actually get protected?
2. Did the compressed thing get completed faster?
3. Did eliminating the eliminated thing free bandwidth?
4. What routing rule needs adjustment?

## Part 6: Stability Score Snapshot

Rate each component (1-10):

| Component | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Obligation Completion | ___/10 | |
| Documentation Currency | ___/10 | |
| Next-Step Clarity | ___/10 | |
| Buffer Zone | ___/10 | |

**Total Stability Score:** ___/40

- 32+ (80%): Green - maintain course
- 24-31 (60-79%): Yellow - identify weak point
- <24 (<60%): Red - intervene now

**Weakest component:** ____________________________________________

**One action to improve it:** ______________________________________

---

## Summary

**Current reality:**  
Most time goes to: ________________________________________________  
Least time goes to: _______________________________________________

**Desired reality:**  
Most time should go to: ___________________________________________  
Least time should go to: __________________________________________

**The gap:**  
Biggest mismatch: _________________________________________________  
Root cause: _______________________________________________________  
First fix: ________________________________________________________
