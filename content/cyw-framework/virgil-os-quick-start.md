# Virgil OS Quick-Start
## Operator Judgment Under Constraints

---

## What is Virgil OS?

Virgil OS is a decision framework for situations where rules don't cover everything. It provides structured judgment for operators who must act with integrity even when information is incomplete, access is limited, or instructions are unclear.

**Core principle:** Judgment is not the absence of rules. Judgment is rule-guided action under uncertainty.

---

## The Operator Loop

All actions within Virgil OS follow one repeatable cycle:

```
OBSERVE -> ESCALATE -> DOCUMENT -> RESUME
```

### 1. OBSERVE
Identify deviations from expected conditions.

**Ask:**
- What's happening that shouldn't be?
- What's not happening that should be?
- What changed?

**Output:** A clear description of the deviation, not an interpretation.

---

### 2. ESCALATE
When thresholds are crossed, route the signal appropriately.

**Escalation triggers:**
- Safety, security, or compliance may be impacted
- Decision exceeds your authority
- Information needed that you don't have
- Consequences extend beyond your scope

**Escalation options:**
- Notify appropriate authority
- Request guidance before acting
- Flag for review without halting
- Defer action but log the deferral

**Not every observation requires escalation.** Escalate when the deviation exceeds your threshold to handle independently.

---

### 3. DOCUMENT
Record what you observed, what you did, and what constraints existed.

**Document:**
- What was observed (facts, not interpretations)
- What action was taken (or deferred)
- Why that action was chosen
- What constraints existed (time, access, information)

**Do not document:**
- Speculation about causes
- Attribution of blame
- Emotional reactions
- Information you cannot verify

**Rule:** Truthful incompleteness is superior to false precision.

---

### 4. RESUME
Return to scope. Don't let escalation derail momentum.

**After documenting:**
- Continue with your primary task
- Set a follow-up checkpoint if needed
- Trust the escalation path to handle what you've routed

**Common mistake:** Allowing one deviation to consume all attention. The loop is designed to process signals without stopping the system.

## Quick Reference Card

| Phase | Question | Output |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Observe** | What's different from expected? | Clear deviation description |
| **Escalate** | Does this exceed my threshold? | Routed signal (or not) |
| **Document** | What happened and what did I do? | Honest, verifiable record |
| **Resume** | What's my next primary action? | Return to scope |

---

## Judgment Under Constraints

Operators frequently act within constraints:
- Restricted access areas
- Time-limited windows
- Incomplete information
- Unclear ownership boundaries

**Virgil OS treats constraints as inputs, not failures.**

When direct action isn't possible:
- Verification may occur via attestation
- Escalation may be deferred but logged
- Summaries may replace granular artifacts

**Integrity is preserved by acknowledging constraints explicitly**, not by ignoring them.

---

## Transparency Rules

### Separate:
- Process gaps from personal fault
- Observed conditions from assumed causes
- Documented fact from interpretive insight

### Documentation should:
- Describe what was observed
- State what actions were taken or deferred
- Avoid speculative attribution
- Avoid unnecessary self-reference

**Transparency strengthens trust only when it is precise.**

---

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Ambiguous Authority
You observe something that needs action, but you're not sure if it's your responsibility.

**Virgil response:**
1. Document the observation
2. Escalate to clarify ownership
3. Note the ambiguity in your record
4. Resume your primary task

---

### Scenario 2: Time Pressure
You don't have time to fully investigate, but something seems wrong.

**Virgil response:**
1. Document what you observed (even briefly)
2. Escalate with a flag for follow-up
3. Note the time constraint
4. Resume; trust the escalation path

---

### Scenario 3: Conflicting Instructions
Two authorities give you contradictory guidance.

**Virgil response:**
1. Document both instructions
2. Escalate the conflict to someone who can resolve it
3. Do not act until clarified (unless safety requires it)
4. Resume once clarity is provided

---

### Scenario 4: No Clear Rule
The situation isn't covered by existing policy.

**Virgil response:**
1. Document the situation and why existing rules don't apply
2. Escalate for guidance if time permits
3. If you must act: choose the option that preserves safety and reversibility
4. Document your reasoning; resume

---

## The Virgil Mindset

Virgil OS is not a system of permission.  
It is a system of **conscious action**.

For operators who:
- Act professionally under pressure
- Document honestly under constraint
- Choose stewardship over silence

---

## Daily Practice

**Morning:** What's my primary scope today? What thresholds trigger escalation?  
**During:** Am I observing or assuming? Is this deviation worth escalating?  
**Evening:** What did I document? What's unresolved for tomorrow?

---

## Integration with CYW

Virgil OS aligns with Control Your World through:

| CYW Principle | Virgil Expression |
|---------------|-------------------|
| **Clarity** | Observe precisely; separate signal from noise |
| **Agency** | Act from judgment, not reaction |
| **Auditability** | Document decisions for traceability |
| **Restraint** | Escalate only when necessary |
| **Continuity** | Resume without letting escalation stop momentum |
