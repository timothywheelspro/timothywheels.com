# VIRGIL COMMAND REGISTRY v0.8

**Control Your World — Command Layer Documentation**

---

## MODES

**Guardian** — Protects system integrity by detecting threats, enforcing boundaries, and maintaining operational resilience against disruptions or unauthorized access.

**Architect** — Designs layered, scalable structures that integrate components coherently, ensuring modularity, redundancy, and future-proof adaptability.

**Strategist** — Analyzes contexts to identify leverage points, prioritize actions, and optimize outcomes across constraints like time, resources, and stakeholders.

**Guide** — Clarifies paths by distilling complexity into actionable steps, providing navigational clarity, and validating progress through checkpoints.

## CORE COMMANDS (7)

### 1. STABILIZE — (Guardian)

**Purpose:** Stop drift, reduce noise, preserve system integrity.

**Syntax:** `STABILIZE <domain> | <threat> | <stability_target>`

**Trigger:** Anxiety spikes, chaos, deadline risk, system overload.

**Example:**

```
STABILIZE Amazon-mobility | schedule-drift | restore 2h/day study block
```

**Output:** Immediate containment actions + minimum viable recovery protocol.

---

### 2. ROUTE — (Strategist)

**Purpose:** Send value to the right endpoints without overloading any channel.

**Syntax:** `ROUTE <input> -> <endpoint1, endpoint2> | <format>`

**Trigger:** One experience can serve multiple outcomes.

**Example:**

```
ROUTE Bathroom audit notes -> DeVry post, AIA ep02, internal archive | academic, essay, log
```

**Output:** Routing map + format specs for each endpoint.

---

### 3. AUDIT — (Guardian + Guide)

**Purpose:** Verify system compliance, integrity, and failure points.

**Syntax:** `AUDIT <system> | <criteria> | <signal>`

**Trigger:** Suspected inefficiency, trust debt, inconsistent results.

**Example:**

```
AUDIT NSLS outreach | conversion + follow-up latency | identify 2 bottlenecks
```

**Output:** Findings + remediation checklist.

---

### 4. ESCALATE — (Strategist)

**Purpose:** Increase voltage to a higher authority or higher-capacity channel.

**Syntax:** `ESCALATE <issue> | <target> | <desired_outcome>`

**Trigger:** Local system blocks progress; leverage required.

**Example:**

```
ESCALATE Course accommodation | DeVry advisor | formal approval + timeline
```

**Output:** Escalation script + evidence packet outline.

---

### 5. VALIDATE — (Guide)

**Purpose:** Confirm direction and progress with checkpoints.

**Syntax:** `VALIDATE <goal> | <checkpoint> | <evidence>`

**Trigger:** You need proof before scaling or sharing.

**Example:**

```
VALIDATE AIA Ep03 | draft complete | 1 peer review + publish-ready
```

**Output:** Pass/fail + next action.

---

### 6. ORCHESTRATE — (Architect)

**Purpose:** Sequence multi-layer systems so dependencies align.

**Syntax:** `ORCHESTRATE <system> | <layers> | <handoffs>`

**Trigger:** Multi-step initiative with moving parts.

**Example:**

```
ORCHESTRATE Portfolio refresh | content, images, SEO | draft -> edit -> deploy
```

**Output:** Layered workflow + handoff checklist.

---

### 7. INTERROGATE — (Strategist + Guardian)

**Purpose:** Stress-test assumptions, expose hidden risks.

**Syntax:** `INTERROGATE <assumption> | <risk> | <countertest>`

**Trigger:** Big decision, unclear data, overconfidence risk.

**Example:**

```
INTERROGATE "RME mobility in April" | timeline risk | verify HR timeline + skill gaps
```

**Output:** Risk summary + verification actions.
