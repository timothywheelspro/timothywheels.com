# Deep Specs

**CYW Systems Architecture — Governance, Verification, and Infrastructure**

Deep Specs is the technical foundation of the CYW (Control Your World) framework: a governance-backed architecture for routing work, verifying outcomes, and maintaining accountability across complex systems.

---

## What CYW Does

CYW operates as middleware for human-led decision systems. It routes work across multiple models and stakeholders using VLAN-style role segmentation, cryptographic verification, and auditable governance trails.

**Core Capabilities:**
- **Triangle Test Protocol** — Three-point validation for critical decisions
- **Four-Gate Authorization** — Staged approval chains with documented handoffs
- **Evidence Vault** — SHA-256 ledgers with OpenTimestamps verification
- **VLAN Routing** — Subpopulation-specific service matching

This isn't a product demo. It's operational infrastructure with public proof.

## Case Studies

### [Case Study 001: NSLS Leadership Development](/case-studies/nsls-leadership/)
National Society of Leadership and Success certification pathway. Documents structured goal-setting, accountability systems, and verified completion.

### [Case Study 002: Homelessness Systems & Healing Infrastructure](/case-studies/homelessness-systems/)
Community-facing work addressing systemic breakdown in housing and services. Demonstrates the human impact model and equity framework.

### [Case Study 003: CYW Integrated Technical Infrastructure](/case-studies/cyw-technical-infrastructure/)
End-to-end systems architecture: governance frameworks, evidence chains, automated deployment pipelines, and public verification. The technical spine of everything else.

---

## Verification

All core artifacts are published and verifiable:

- **[Verification Portal](/verification/)** — Public integrity checks, signed manifests, anchor records
- **[Leadership Brief](/ideas-to-impact/)** — Executive summary of the governance approach

Evidence includes:
- GPG-signed commits and releases
- SHA-256 hashes logged in evidence vault
- OpenTimestamps blockchain anchoring
- CI/CD verification workflows

---

## Grant & Positioning Work

Deep Specs supports institutional applications:

- **[SVHC CoC Grant Narrative](/positioning/grants/svhc-ces/)** — HUD FY2026 Coordinated Entry enhancement proposal
- **[Master Positioning Packet](/positioning/grants/packet/)** — Modular narrative for funders, fellowships, and partners

These documents demonstrate how CYW governance translates to real-world service delivery systems.

## Architecture Layers

| Layer | Function | Artifacts |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Platform** | Public-facing sites | timothywheels.com, cyw-os.com, contruil.com |
| **Governance** | Frameworks and protocols | CYW, Virgil OS, Triangle Test, Four-Gate |
| **Evidence** | Cryptographic verification | Vault, hashes, timestamps, manifests |
| **Operations** | Deployment and release | Scripts, CI workflows, signed tags |
| **Documentation** | Case studies and packets | CS001-003, grant narratives, briefs |

## Lab Environment

For experimental deployments and productization work:

**[CYW-OS.com](https://cyw-os.com)** — Development environment for testing new governance patterns before promotion to canonical infrastructure.

This is secondary to the main architecture. Production-grade artifacts live here on timothywheels.com.

## Source Repositories

```
Canonical repository: https://github.com/timothywheelspro/virgil-governance-core
Publication repository: https://github.com/timothywheelspro/timothywheels.com
```

The canonical repository contains versioned source artifacts, governance documentation, and cryptographic verification chains. The publication repository renders these for public access.
