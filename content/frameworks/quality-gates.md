## The Purpose of Gates

Every system needs checkpoints that stop defects from moving downstream. Quality gates enforce the pause required to verify safety, stability, and traceability.

These gates are designed to fit within active operations without slowing momentum.

## The Four Gate Model

**Gate 1: Pre-Work Readiness**  
Tools, parts, and lockout steps confirmed. No improvisation.

**Gate 2: Change Integrity**  
Work completed to spec. Torque, alignment, and calibration verified.

**Gate 3: Operational Validation**  
System runs under real load without alarms or drift.

**Gate 4: Documentation Closure**  
Work order updated with root cause, photos, and test results. Next PM interval adjusted if needed.

## What This Prevents

- Repeat failures from incomplete fixes
- Silent defects that show up on next shift
- Lack of accountability when issues recur
- Untracked work that cannot be audited
- Preventive maintenance intervals based on guesswork instead of failure data

## Practical Implementation

**Small fixes:** Gates 1, 2, and 4.  
**Medium fixes:** Gates 1 through 3.  
**High-risk fixes:** All gates plus a second tech review.

## Example: Sensor Replacement

**Gate 1:** Correct sensor model verified, lockout completed.  
**Gate 2:** Sensor mounted, wired, and aligned to spec.  
**Gate 3:** Run at full speed for 30 minutes without faults.  
**Gate 4:** Work order updated with root cause, photos, and test results. PM interval adjusted if needed.

## RME Translation

This model supports:
- PM compliance
- Reliability metrics
- Shift handoff clarity
- Audit readiness
