## The Poem

Logs weave the unseen thread  
From shift to credential spread  
Like mud I patch, I make my bed  
At times I dread I move too slow, I break instead  

My feet get weary, I try too hard  
The bets on me I play my cards  
Invest in self, at times it's hard  
To honor codes designed that's birthed from heart  

A guinea pig I run while conveyors drag  
Avoiding jams in dark spaces at times I lag  
To keep pace in real time I cut the volume down  
Found myself with integral guilt, I can't perform like I want to now  

I checked my ego at the door and found myself the focus of this audit now  
It's business never pleasure, the system can be so heartless now  
Do I play the clown, the fool, and abuse the game  
By downsizing my output, to optimize what's proven and stay my lane  

Or be that motion, that drift, that shift, anomalous gain  
You can't pinpoint or describe it because we're not the same  
I don't get caught up in labels and titles, because that is not my name  
The proof is in the data beyond the surface layer and that's how I build my frame  

Small decisions compound generating transactional tractioned gain  
Segmented or fractal, we're all just embers of fire with a core desire to be close to the origin flame  
The flame that feeds and makes us fight through pain  
To prove our worth, and true value we build relationships and formed alliances with success  

Where success goes, success follows—and yes, this is just a test  
Not of the emergency broadcast system, because in this age of AI everything is digitized  
So how do we operate in real time when you got the people behind you,  
But the system is desensitized?

## Performance Notes

### **Context**

This poem was written and performed following an incident at Amazon ORF3 where I received two write-ups in one day after completing a detailed bathroom facility audit. The audit was requested by the Associate Activities Committee, but my comprehensive, analytical approach was perceived as exceeding expectations in a way that created friction rather than recognition.

The poem explores the tension between:
- **Precision vs. Compliance** - Delivering enterprise-level documentation to a system expecting baseline work
- **Identity vs. Labels** - Being defined by output quality rather than job titles
- **Human Value vs. System Requirements** - The question of whether to "downsize output" to fit organizational expectations

### **Thematic Structure**

**Stanzas 1-2 (Lines 1-8):** Setting the scene - Physical exhaustion, pressure, the cost of trying hard

**Stanza 3 (Lines 9-12):** Pressure building - The conveyor belt metaphor, falling behind, cutting volume to survive

**Stanza 4 (Lines 13-16):** The confrontation - Being audited, the choice between dimming output or staying authentic

**Stanza 5 (Lines 17-20):** The deeper question - Identity beyond labels, proof in data not performance theater

**Stanza 6 (Lines 21-24):** Universal expansion - Moving from personal experience to shared human condition

**Stanza 7 (Lines 25-28):** The challenge - Final question left hanging without resolution

### **Performance Rhythm**

**Stanzas 1-2:** Steady, measured pace (establishing the foundation)  
**Stanza 3:** Slight acceleration (pressure mounting)  
**Stanza 4:** Peak intensity (the audit confrontation)  
**Stanza 5:** Reflective, philosophical (stepping back to analyze)  
**Stanza 6:** Expansive, universal (zooming out to shared experience)  
**Stanza 7:** Grounded, direct (landing the final challenge)

### **Key Emphasis Points**

- **"I checked my ego at the door and found myself the focus of this audit now"** ← Pause after this line. Let it land.

- **"You can't pinpoint or describe it because we're not the same"** ← Power delivery. This is declaration, not explanation.

- **"The proof is in the data beyond the surface layer"** ← Technical precision. This line should feel like code.

- **"How do we operate in real time when you got the people behind you, but the system is desensitized?"** ← Leave it hanging. No resolution. Let the audience sit with the question.

### **Connection to Awareness In Action**

This poem is the **compressed, emotional version** of what [Episode 2: Validation Theater vs. Forward Progress](/awareness-in-action/ep02-validation-theater/) explores in prose.

**The poem asks:** "Do I downsize my output or be anomalous gain?"

**Episode 2 answers:** "Route power to circuits rated for your capacity."

**Together they demonstrate:** The same experience processed through two different layers—poetry for immediate impact, prose for analytical depth.

This is multi-endpoint value routing in practice.
