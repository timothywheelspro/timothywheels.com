title: "SVHC CES Positioning"
---

This page anchors my positioning for SVHC’s Coordinated Entry System (CES) and related HUD CoC applications.

It connects:

- CYW Prevention Middleware for SVHC CES (SSO – Coordinated Entry)
- Human impact and systems architecture narratives
- Governance-backed implementation model (Case Study 003) and verification portal
