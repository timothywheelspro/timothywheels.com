This is not a resume. It is a network diagram of the toolchain behind the Clarity Architecture.

## The Routing Protocol: How Work Moves Through the System

---

## Academic Layer: Network Foundation

**NETW191 | Network Fundamentals**
- Cisco Packet Tracer (topology design, VLAN segmentation)
- Wireshark (packet analysis, protocol inspection)
- Subnet calculators (IP addressing, CIDR notation)
- **Key translation:** Applied OSI model thinking to warehouse operations - Physical layer (conveyors), Data Link (scanner protocols), Network (routing paths), Application (manager dashboards)

**NETW212 | Switching and Routing**
- VLANs, trunking, inter-VLAN routing
- ACLs (Access Control Lists)
- Static and dynamic routing protocols
- **Key translation:** Used VLAN logic to architect the CYW multi-model pipeline - each AI gets a dedicated role with controlled inter-model communication

**ECON312 | Economics**
- CapEx vs OpEx frameworks
- Cost-benefit analysis at infrastructure scale
- **Key translation:** Applied to Amazon operational decisions and Contruil business modeling

## Production Layer: The CYW Pipeline

**Multi-Model AI Orchestration** (VLAN-style routing)

```
Research VLAN    -> Perplexity  (source gathering, citation chains)
Narrative VLAN   -> Claude      (expansion, structure, voice alignment)
Clarity VLAN     -> Gemini      (audit for cognitive load, coherence)
Critique VLAN    -> DeepSeek    (structural analysis, edge case detection)
Integration VLAN -> ChatGPT     (final synthesis, delivery formatting)
```

**Routing rules:**
- No model sees another model's output until its designated stage
- Each VLAN has explicit input/output contracts
- Final integration only happens after all checkpoints pass

---

## Deployment Layer: Publishing Infrastructure

**Hugo + PaperMod Theme**
- Static site generator (security, speed, version control)
- Markdown-first workflow (portability, minimal dependencies)
- GitHub Pages (zero-cost hosting, CI/CD via Git)

**Why this stack:**
- **Low attack surface:** Static HTML, no databases, no server-side execution
- **Full version control:** Every edit tracked, every deployment reversible
- **Portability:** Content exists as plain text, survives any platform migration

---

## Operational Layer: Amazon and NSLS Systems

**Waterspider Operations (ORF3 Fulfillment Center)**
- Inventory management systems (tracking 9 football fields of physical infrastructure)
- Safety audit protocols (the same "extreme visibility" that triggered the write-up)
- Cross-functional coordination (Receive, Stow, Pick, Pack, Ship)

**NSLS Executive Membership Outreach (500+ member coordination)**
- CRM systems (member tracking, engagement metrics)
- Event logistics (speaker coordination, venue management)
- Communication pipelines (broadcast messaging, 1:1 follow-up protocols)

---

## Development Layer: Emerging Infrastructure

**Unity/3D Prototyping** (CYW spatial interfaces)
- Game engine architecture for interactive clarity tools
- 3D environment design for cognitive load visualization

**Patent Documentation Systems**
- Triangle Test Protocol (systematic validation framework)
- Four-Gate Authorization (multi-model orchestration governance)

**Newsletter Pipeline** ("Awareness In Action")
- Research -> Draft -> Multi-model audit -> Publish -> Distribute
- Consistent formatting (essay structure, no greetings, system metaphors)

---

## The Pattern

Every layer - academic, production, deployment, operational - follows the same principle:

**Explicit boundaries. Clear failure modes. Predictable cost of change.**

Whether it is VLANs in a Cisco lab, AI models in a content pipeline, or inventory zones in a warehouse - the routing logic stays consistent.

**This is how you Control Your World.**

Tools change. Routing principles do not.
